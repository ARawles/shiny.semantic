In this tutorial we will walk you through the basics of `shiny.semantic`. 

## Quick Q&A

First of all, let's answer a few questions:

- **Why do I need `shiny.semantic`?**

You can build your `shiny` apps with standard shiny UI that relies on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
This means that `shiny` attaches CSS and JS code that is responsible for its neat look.
Howver, after a while you might notice that all apps made this way tend to look quite similar.
`shiny.semantic` helps you to add a fresh look to your web application by providing alternative
UI framework that works under the hood.

- **What `shiny.semantic` has to do with Fomantic UI?**

Similarly to shiny attaching *Bootstrap* CSS and JS libraries, `shiny.semantic` relies on
[Fomantic UI](fomantic-ui.com/). Historically, we build this package around *Semantic UI*
library, but it got deprecated and now we rely on the well-supported and maintained 
community fork: [Fomantic UI](fomantic-ui.com/).

- **Do I need to learn a new syntax to be able to use it?**

Not at all! For you convenience we created wrappers of the most popular functions
that you know from `shiny`. For example you can create an action button using
snake case (which is default `shiny.semantic` standard): `action_button`, or
you can use known from `shiny` camel case with consistent parameters: `actionButton`.

**Note** however that the philosophy behind the *Bootstrap* and *Fomantic* is quite
different, so some behaviour might be different. Usually `shiny.semantic` warns you about
that or you can learn about it from the documentation.


## How to use `shiny.semantic`?

You can use `shiny.semantic` in two ways:

### (a) Using Fomantic CSS classes

If you know this and that about web development, you can create a number of components
by extending standard `shiny` objects with class definitions from [Fomantic UI](fomantic-ui.com/)
documentation. For example:

```{r echo=T, include = T, screenshot.force = FALSE}
uirender(
  div(class = "ui raised segment",
    div(
      a(class="ui green ribbon label", "Link"),
      p("Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum"),
      actionButton("button", "Click")
    )
  ),
width = "400px", height = "150px")
```


### (b) Using predefined objects

If you are not that comfortable with the web development, you can take advantage of the 
number of elements that we implemented for you. See some examples it below:

```{r echo = T, include = T, eval = FALSE, screenshot.force = FALSE}
range_input("range", 10, 15, 0, 20)
text_input("txt", type = "text", placeholder = "Enter Text")
date_input("date")
```

For more components visit our [Components live demo website](https://demo.appsilon.ai/semantic/)
or the `examples/` folder on our [repository](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic/).

See some of the interactive elements below:

If you want to learn how to use a particular UI component, check its documentation. For example  you can call in RStudio:

```{r echo = T, include = T, eval = FALSE, screenshot.force = FALSE}
?counter_button
```

or use our [documentation website](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.semantic/).

All examples come with easy to use code snippets that help you get started.
We hope that this short overview was useful. Good luck with building your first amazing
app with `shiny.semantic` :)
